# iSDC-P2-Translate-Python-Cpp

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to take the python code I wrote when I implemented the two dimensional histogram filter and translate it into C++.

The job was to complete the functions marked with TODO comments until the histogram filter worked as expected.

The correctness of your code was checked by compiling tests.cpp and then running the output. This was done by running the following from the command line.

g++ tests.cpp
./a.out
